              Hello! My name is Jaz, I am the Candy Shop Runner. I successfully
              identified you as a verified Chain Runner. Usually I sell regular
              candies, but you seem pretty informed.
              <br />
              Indeed, I have a few things that you might be interested in. But
              be careful, never speak about it to Somnus.

              Sorry, if you want to use my basement to eat some candy, you'll
              have to buy it first. Go back to the Candy Shop and choose your
              poison.

              In the night of the 7th opening day, a horde of 50 angry Chain
              Runners have invaded the shop, and stolen all Helium Spice. They
              sold the Spice all around Mega City and have drawn the place into
              chaos. All Runners who couldnâ€™t consume the Spice in proper
              conditions in my Basement have fallen into endless dreams.
              <br />
              <br />
              They're all locked up in Jail now.
              <br />
              <br />
              The 50 thieves have taken the shop, I speak now under their
              control.
